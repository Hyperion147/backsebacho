# Backsebacho - Web Development Concepts

## Overview

**Backsebacho** is a documentation-based platform designed specifically for college students studying web development. Unlike traditional tutorials that focus heavily on modern frameworks and practical implementation, this project emphasizes the **theoretical foundations, academic definitions, and core concepts** often required in university curricula and exams.

Our goal is to help you understand the _why_ and _what_ behind web technologies, not just the _how_.

## Features

- **Concept-Focused Documentation**: Deep dives into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript theory.
- **Academic Syllabus Alignment**: Content structured to match common college web development courses.
- **Definitions & Terminology**: Clear explanations of technical terms often asked in vivas and written exams.
- **Exam Preparation**: Key points and summaries to help with last-minute revision.
- **Minimalist Design**: A clean, distraction-free reading experience built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Documentation Structure

The content is organized into three primary pillars:

1.  **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Structure, semantics, document object model (DOM) theory, and accessibility standards.
2.  **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: The box model, specificity, layout algorithms (Flexbox/Grid theory), and responsive design principles.
3.  **JavaScript**: Core language syntax, execution context, prototypes, closures, and event loop mechanics.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally for development or study:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backsebacho.git
    cd backsebacho
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using:

- **Next.js 15+**: For static site generation and routing.
- **React**: Component-based architecture.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for a clean, modern UI.
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and code quality.
